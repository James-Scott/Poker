Seems to still be a bug when winners have the same hand, logic seems right but it never actually has more than one winner (1000 hands played, etc)

Need to eliminate any players when they reach 0 chips. Also need to stop the game and prevent any more actions (bets, etc) when only one player remaing because they won
